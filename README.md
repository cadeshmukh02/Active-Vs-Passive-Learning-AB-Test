# Active-Vs-Passive-Learning-AB-Test

This project evaluates the impact of active (quiz-based) versus passive (notes-based) learning on student engagement, preparedness, and recall using a randomized A/B testing framework. Conducted with 95 graduate students, the experiment used stratified randomization with gender-based blocking and was administered via Qualtrics to ensure controlled assignment and balance across groups.

We analyzed treatment effects using ATE, CATE, regression modeling, and power analysis, focusing on post-class participation, recall, and perceived understanding. While overall treatment effects were not statistically significant due to limited power, the analysis revealed meaningful heterogeneous effects by gender and prior case exposure. Results highlight the importance of tailoring active learning interventions based on learner characteristics and prior preparation, with implications for education, corporate training, and data-driven experimentation design.
